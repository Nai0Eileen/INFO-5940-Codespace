Working on the multi-agent travel planner helped me understand how two AI agents can work together like a small team. The Planner Agent focused on making creative trip ideas and writing clear day-by-day plans, while the Reviewer Agent checked if the details made sense and were realistic. This teamwork made the final plan feel more natural and believable. It was interesting to see how each agent had a different role but still worked toward the same goal. I think this kind of setup is similar to how people work together on a project: one person creates ideas and another person reviews and improves them.
The internet search tool made the Reviewer more useful because it could look up real information instead of guessing. It was able to check things like opening hours, prices, and travel times. Seeing the search results appear live in the sidebar made it clear that the Reviewer was actually using online data to make decisions. This part helped me understand how tools and AI prompts can be combined to create a more complete system. It also showed that giving clear, simple instructions is important so each agent knows exactly what to do.
Overall, I learned a great deal about how AI agents can collaborate and support each other’s work. The Planner created something interesting and detailed, and the Reviewer made sure it stayed accurate and practical. The results looked balanced between creativity and facts. If I could improve one thing, I would make the Reviewer show a short “Checked Facts” table with items it verified, the updated information, and the source link. That would make the final result easier to read and help users trust that the plan was checked with real data.
